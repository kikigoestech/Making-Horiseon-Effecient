# Code Refactor 


## Composing Cleaner code and making the website more Accessible for EVERYONE


### My client Horiseon was worried that their website was not as accessible as it could be and the original code was not as clean as they would like.  Had potential however still had a few things that could be better. 


A few things this project aimed to improve


1.*SEO Optimization*

2.*Consolidating CSS selectors and properties*

3.*Ensure all links function correctly* 

Now that the code has been refactored when the client views the source code they will find semantic HTML elements. When the structure of HTML elements is viewed they will find that the elements follow a more logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Also now when the client views all icon and image elements they will find accessible alt attributes. These are just a few of many solutions we have solved with this project !
