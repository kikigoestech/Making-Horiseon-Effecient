## Composing Cleaner code and making the website more Accessible for EVERYONE


### My client Horiseon was worried that their website was not as accessible as it could be and the original code was not as clean as they would like.  Had potential however still had a few things that could be better. 


A few things this project aimed to improve


1.*SEO Optimization*

2.*Consolidating CSS selectors and properties*

3.*Ensure all links function correctly*
